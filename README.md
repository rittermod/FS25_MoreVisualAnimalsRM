# FS25 More Visual Animals - Ritter version
This is a modified version of the [FS25 More Visual Animals](https://github.com/Arrow-kb/FS25_MoreVisualAnimals) mod by [Arrow-kb](https://github.com/Arrow-kb), originally a standalone module from RealisticLivestock. Arrow-kb has decided to stop all development of his mods.

See more of your animals! Increases the number of visible animals in husbandries beyond the game's default limits, making your pens and pastures feel alive. The visual animal cap is raised to up to 200 per husbandry, and an in-game slider (Shift+T) lets you adjust the limit to match your system's performance.

Singleplayer only. Does nothing if RealisticLivestock is active (that mod includes this functionality).

Main changes from the original mod:
- Fixed compatibility with other mods that hook into vehicle enter logic (e.g. CabCinematic).

## Features

- **Increased Visual Animals:** Up to 200 visible animals per husbandry (game default is much lower)
- **In-Game Slider:** Press Shift+T to open a dialog and adjust the visual animal limit
- **Recommended Button:** Suggests a limit based on your PC's performance profile
- **Persistent Settings:** Your chosen limit is saved and restored across sessions
- **RealisticLivestock Safe:** Automatically disables when RealisticLivestock is active

## Usage

1. Install the mod and load your game
2. Press **Shift+T** to open the Visual Animals dialog
3. Use the slider to set your desired limit, or press **Recommended** for a performance-based suggestion
4. Press **Apply** to save your setting

## Limitations

- Singleplayer only
- Higher limits may reduce FPS depending on your hardware
- Only changes visual representation - does not increase actual animal capacity
- Not needed if using RealisticLivestock (visual animals are included in that mod)

## License
This mod is released under GPL-3 license. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

# About reuse, modification and building upon the original More Visual Animals mod by Arrow-kb

> [!NOTE]
> TL;DR: The original More Visual Animals mod by Arrow-kb is open source GPL-3 licensed. Anyone can freely use, modify, and redistribute it as long as they: give credit, keep the same GPL-3 license, and share their changes openly. No one can restrict reuse.



The original More Visual Animals mod by Arrow-kb is released under GPL-3 license. This means that anyone are free to reuse and modify the mod (the work) as long as they comply with the terms of the GPL-3 license, which in short terms means, to the best of my understanding:
- You are free to use, reuse, and modify the code/mod for any purpose.
- You must provide attribution to the author(s) when you distribute reused/modified/built upon code.
- You must release your own modified code/mod under the same GPL-3 license so others can build upon it too.
- You must include a copy of the GPL-3 license with the mod.

This means that **anyone can use, and build upon, any modification I make** in this Ritter version of the More Visual Animals mod **without any prior consent** or similar **from me, as long as they too comply with the GPL-3 license terms**, attibute me for the changes I have made AND release their modified code/mod under the same GPL-3 license for any changes/additions they have made.

It **also means** that **anyone, including me, can reuse and build opon any changes made by others** to the mod **without any prior consent** or similar **from the authors of those modifications** since their changes to the mod are also licensed under the same GPL-3.

**Nobody can say, "No, this is my code, you can not reuse it".** The GPL-3 license ensures that the code/mod and any mod built on it will always remain free and open for anyone to use, modify, and distribute under the same GPL-3 license terms. There might at some point a discussion about when is a mod no longer a "mod built on the original mod" but that is way over my paygrade.

And **remember**: Any vioation of this might not be intentional or malicious. People might simply not understand the implications of what they agreed to when they started building upon the mod with this license.

(I am not a OSS licensing lawyer, but most likeley neither are you. This is my understanding of the GPL-3 license as it applies to this mod. If you have **QUALIFIED** legal knowledge, and not armchair legal knowledge, that contradicts what I say here, please let me know.)
